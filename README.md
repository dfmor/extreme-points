# extreme-points

Extreme nonsignaling points used for calculations in *"Communication-constrained nonlocal correlations"*.

- Each file contains one representative per class of nonsignaling extreme points of the corresponding Bell scenario.
- $a_x$ denotes Alice’s outcome for the measurement $x$.
- $b_y$ denotes Bob’s outcome for the measurement $y$.

The points are written in terms of correlators, such that

$\langle a_x \rangle = \; p(1 \mid x) - p(0 \mid x)$ \
$\langle b_y \rangle = \; p(1 \mid y) - p(0 \mid y)$ \
$\langle a_x b_y \rangle = \; p(a = b \mid x,y) - p(a \neq b \mid x,y)$
